      <h2>GOLS ORGANIC CERTIFIED LATEX</h2>
      <p>
        The best mattresses in the world are made with organic, 100% natural
        latex rubber. No other material comes close in terms of comfort,
        breathability, resiliency, elasticity, motion isolation, durability,
        support, and even biodegradability. It makes a superior comfort and
        support layer. (We use it for both.) And the most desirable and scarce
        latex is GOLS organic certified latex — grown ethically, sustainably,
        and responsibly — without persistent pesticides and herbicides, on
        USDA's NOP organic-certified family cooperatives, and processed in
        organic-certified facilities to stringent standards. Although organic
        latex may look the same as natural, blended, or synthetic latex, it’s
        not. Organic latex is safe for farmers and their families, better for
        you, and better for the planet. Avocado Organic Latex is the only latex
        we use.

      <div class="hand-text">
        <h2>IT BEGINS WITH RUBBER TREE TAPPING</h2>
        <p>
          Tapping a rubber tree (Hevea Brasiliensis) requires a skilled hand.
          Early in the morning, our tappers use a metal gouge with a sharp tip
          to make a shallow cut in the outer bark, at a downward angle, winding
          ribbon around the tree. This opens the network of continuous latex
          vessels that spiral around the tree without harming it. (Fun fact:
          Until the rubber trees are mature enough to harvest latex, we grow
          pineapple around them.)

        <h2>MILKY WHITE LATEX, DRIP BY DRIP</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the winding channel, the tapper makes a downward cut and
          hangs a small metal cup neatly from the side of the tree. As the milky
          white latex begins to flow and drip, it’s collected in the cup. Each
          rubber tree provides about 15 grams of latex per day.

      <div class="store-text">
        <h2>OUR FARMERS COLLECT THE LATEX SAP</h2>
        <p>
          After four to six hours, the collection cup is filled with latex sap.
          The rubber tree can be harvested in this way about two to three times
          a week, except during the dry season, for approximately 25 years. No
          polluting machines or power tools are needed.

        <h2>12 ACRES FOR ONE LATEX MATTRESS</h2>
        <p>
          To make a queen-size organic latex mattress, it requires the full
          output of approximately 2,500 rubber trees spread over 10 to 12 acres.
          But instead of harming the environment, the organic farming process
          helps it. The same number of trees will, over the course of one year,
          remove 143 tons of carbon dioxide from the air. They also provide
          habitat for animals and livestock, preserve the health of our forests,
          contribute to healthy water, and provide gainful employment for family
          farmers where jobs are often scarce.

        Latex mattresses are increasingly popular for their extreme comfort and
        durability. They are also associated with eco-friendly practices and
        enhanced sleep health. However, not all latex mattresses carry these
        benefits. So how do you choose the best latex mattress for you, or know
        if a latex mattress is right for you at all? In this article, we will
        define what a latex mattress is, go over the different types of latex
        mattresses, and discuss how they provide a good night’s sleep.
      </p>
      <h2>What Is a Latex Mattress?</h2>
      <p>
        A latex mattress is constructed from two to four layers of latex foam,
        and there are three different types of latex foam: synthetic, blended,
        and natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        Synthetic latex mattresses are primarily crafted from a rubber-mimicking
        plastic called styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). SBR is also used in
        artificial turfs, tires, and conveyor belts. Latex mattresses with SBR
        are safe and an affordable alternative to natural latex but not nearly
        as durable. Additionally, off-gassing chemicals irritating to people
        with respiratory issues are prevalent in synthetic latex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blended latex mattresses contain less toxic chemicals. These types of
        beds are 30 percent natural latex and 70 percent synthetic latex.
        Blended mattresses last longer than synthetic latex, but not natural
        latex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural latex is more supportive, durable, eco-friendly, and better for
        sleep health than synthetic and blended latex. It is harvested and
        refined from the milk-like sap of a rubber tree called Hevea
        Brasiliensis. This process encourages the healthy growth of rubber trees
        as they can be tapped for up to 30 years. Once the sap is harvested, it
        is processed into Dunlop or Talalay foam; both are soft, supportive, and
        extremely durable. We will discuss the differences between Dunlop and
        Talalay later. First, let’s dive deeper into the benefits of a natural
        latex bed.

      <h2>Five Benefits of a Natural Latex Mattress</h2>
      <p>
        Natural latex beds are preferable to synthetic and blended latex for
        their eco-friendliness, durability, and health benefits.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Pain Relieving</h4>
      <p>
        The gentle cushioning and buoyant support of latex foam mattresses are
        especially beneficial for sleepers with back and joint pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latex foam softly cradles heavy body parts, such as the hips and
        shoulders. This light contouring provides pressure relief near the
        joints and lower back, while latex’s natural elasticity maintains
        natural spinal alignment by gently supporting lighter areas, like the
        neck and back.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Hypoallergenic and Low Maintenance</h4>
      <p>
        If a bed is not continually cleaned, microorganisms, such as bacteria,
        fungi, and viruses can easily collect on the top of the mattress and
        cause mold, mildew, and dust mites. This results in bedroom allergies
        and an unsafe sleeping environment. However, latex is naturally
        antimicrobial, meaning it repels harmful microorganisms, making latex an
        excellent choice for people with year-round allergies or anyone too
        tight on time to sanitize their mattress.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Eco-friendly</h4>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, natural latex is refined from the sap of the rubber
        tree. The trees are not cut down or damaged during this process and can
        produce sap for up to 30 years. Therefore, the processing of latex
        mattresses encourages tree growth and is extremely sustainable. Natural
        latex is also biodegradable, ensuring it won’t sit in a landfill for
        years.
      </p>
      <img src="./resource/images/post.jpg" alt="" />
      <h4>4. Breathable</h4>
      <p>
        Natural latex foam has an open-cell structure to permit constant
        airflow. The foam layers are also constructed with pinholes, enhancing
        breathability. Most importantly, chemicals found in synthetic materials
        retain body heat and natural latex mattresses contain little to no
        additives. If you want an especially cool mattress, opt for a breathable
        cover made from cotton or wool.
      </p>
      <h4>5. Durable</h4>
      <p>
        Natural latex mattresses are best known for their long-term comfort.
        High-quality latex mattresses have an average lifespan of 12 to 20
        years—significantly longer than other types of mattresses. The
        resiliency of natural rubber is often credited for this longevity. A
        natural latex mattress effortlessly bounces back once the pressure is
        removed, maintaining its original shape over years of use.
